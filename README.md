This project is a college assignment where I needed to create a API to simulate Reddit.
In order to run this project a .env file must be created at the ROOT directory with the following variables:

DATABASE_USER='DB user'

DATABASE_PASSWORD='DB password'

DATABASE_HOST='localhost to run locally or your server address'

DATABASE_PORT='5432 Postgres, 3306 MySQL'

DATABASE_DB='DB name'

AUTH_SECRET='Authentication Salt'
